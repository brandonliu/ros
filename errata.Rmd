## 1st (2020) printing

- p. 11, the summary of the treatment-control comparison says "the treated units were 4.8 points higher than the controls, $\bar{y} = 31.7$ under the treatment and $\bar{y} = 25.5$ for the controls." The difference in shown means is 6.2 and not 4.8.  Not that these values change when rerunning the simulation. (thanks Desislava Petkova)
- p. 15, "multiplicative factor; see Exercise 3.8." $\rightarrow$ "multiplicative factor; see Exercise 4.8." (thanks to Omri Har-Shemesh and Juliette Unwin)
- p. 39, in the second sentence of the first full paragraph, "Figure 3.4 displays data on log metabolic rate vs. body mass indicating..." $\rightarrow$ "log metabolic rate vs. log body mass" (thanks Ravi Shroff)
- p. 42, the last line, in "Linear transformations" section "Exercise 3.5" $\rightarrow$ "Exercise 3.6". (thanks Ed Berry)
- p. 43, "$\sigma_a,\sigma_b$" $\rightarrow$ $\sigma_u,\sigma_v$ (thanks to braden-scherting)
- p. 54, in "Comparisons, visual and numerical" subsection, "Figure 4.2" in the first sentence should be "Figure 4.3." (thanks Ravi Shroff)
- p. 55, `se_weighted_avg <- sqrt(sum(W*se)^2)` $\rightarrow$ `se_weighted_avg <- sqrt(sum((W*se)^2))` (thanks to Desislava Petkova)
- p. 57, last line: `n_C+n_T, 2` $\rightarrow$ `n_C+n_T-2` (thanks Justin Reppert)
- p. 61, "$T(y;\phi(y))$, for $j = 1,\dots, J$" $\rightarrow$ "$T(y;\phi_j(y))$, for $j = 1,\dots, J$" (thanks to Kenneth Tay)
- p. 73, `1.483*median(abs(y - median(z)))` $\rightarrow$ 1.483*median(abs(z - median(z)))
- p. 73, `quantile(z, 0.25, 0.75)` $\rightarrow$ quantile(z, c(0.25, 0.75)) and `quantile(z, 0.025, 0.975)` $\rightarrow$ quantile(z, c(0.025, 0.975)) (thanks to Justin Reppert)
- p. 83, Fig 6.1 "y = 0.49 + 0.27 * x" $\rightarrow$ "y = 0.4 + 0.27 * x"
- p. 83, Fig 6.2 Estimate for $\sigma$ should be 0.49 (not 0.43)
- p. 84, "which returns the value R^2 = 0.10, meaning that the linear model accounts for only 9% of the variance". The "9%" should be "10%".
- p. 116, the correct code should have `y_linpred <- a + b*as.numeric(new)` and `y_pred <- a + b*as.numeric(new) + rnorm(n_sims, 0, sigma)` (thanks to Nathan Hoffmann)
- p. 128, "Do Exercise 3.8" $\rightarrow$ "Do Exercise 4.8" (thanks to Omri Har-Shemesh and Juliette Unwin)
- p. 143, the correct values for mean and sd in the last column of Figure 10.7 are 260.1 and 2.5 (thanks to Eam O'Brien)
- p. 143, 3rd line from bottom the correct values for mean and sd mentioned in the text are 260.1 and 2.5 (thanks to Eam O'Brien)
- p. 159, "as in Figure 11.2" $\rightarrow$ "as in Figure 11.3" (thanks to Eam O'Brien)
- p. 174, "and so the log score is  $-\frac{1}{2}\log\sigma$" $\rightarrow$ "and so the log score is  $-\log\sigma$" (thanks to Matěj Grabovsky)
- p. 179, `fit_2 <- update(fit_2, prior=hs())` $\rightarrow$ `fit_2 <- update(fit_1, prior=hs())` (thanks to Omri Har-Shemesh)
- p. 208, `/sqrt(0.3*26)` $\rightarrow$ `*sqrt(0.3/26)` (this is correct in the code in the web page, typo fix in the book thanks to Eugenia Migliavacca)
- p. 208, Figure 12.11 all top row subplots show the prior distribution for the regularized horseshoe prior. The correct subplot are produced by the R code in [Student example](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/Student/student.html) and shown below (thanks to Zhengchen Cai for reporting the issue)

- p. 217, First line in section 13.1 "The logistic function, logit(x)" $\rightarrow$ "The logit function, logit(x)" (thanks to VicentModesto)
- p. 219, "The inverse logistic function is curved" $\rightarrow$ "The inverse logit function is curved" (thanks to VicentModesto)
- p. 288, Chapter 15 Bibliographic note is missing the reference to the RiskyBehavior data: "The HIV risk data (RiskyBehavior) used in exercises comes fromcomes from El-Bassel et al (2003)."

- p. 316, Figure 17.2 the values in the column $N_j/N$ should be $0.16, 0.17, 0.19, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15$ as in the code on the same page. (thanks to Noah Silbert)
- p. 371, "in Figure 19.4a" $\rightarrow$ "in Figure 19.4b" (thanks to Kenneth Tay)
- p. 385, equation number (20.1) should be for the second equation on the page $y_i = \beta^*_0 + \beta^*_1z_i + \epsilon^*_i$ (thanks to Matěj Grabovsky)
