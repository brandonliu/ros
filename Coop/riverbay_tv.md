## Data

``` r

  file_votes %>% 
  read_csv(
    col_names = 
      c("name_1", "600", "1200", "2444", "3444", "4444", "5553", "name_2")
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !starts_with("name"),
    names_to = "voters",
    names_transform = list(voters = as.double),
    values_to = "votes"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(name_1) %>% 
  mutate(
    vote_prop_cum = votes / voters,
    vote_prop_new = 
      (votes - lag(votes, default = 0, order_by = voters)) / 
      (voters - lag(voters, default = 0, order_by = voters))
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Candidates who received the most votes

``` r
voters <- 
  votes %>% 
  pull(voters) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sort()
voters_total <- max(voters)

votes %>% 
  filter(voters == voters_total) %>% 
  select(starts_with("name"), votes) %>% 
  arrange(desc(votes))
```
