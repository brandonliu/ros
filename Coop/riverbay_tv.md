# Parameters
  # Votes in an election
file_votes <- here::here("Coop/data/Riverbay.csv")
  # Common code
file_common <- here::here("_common.R")

## Data

``` r
votes <- 
  file_votes %>% 
  read_csv(
    col_names = 
      c("name_1", "600", "1200", "2444", "3444", "4444", "5553", "name_2")
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !starts_with("name"),
    names_to = "voters",
    names_transform = list(voters = as.double),
    values_to = "votes"
  )
```

Candidates who received the most votes

``` r
voters <- 
  votes %>% 
  pull(voters) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sort()
voters_total <- max(voters)

votes %>% 
  filter(voters == voters_total) %>% 
  select(!voters) %>% 
  arrange(desc(votes))
```

### Cummulative vote percentages at different points in counting

``` r

### Vote percentages of new votes at different points in counting

``` r

### Standard deviation of vote proportions of new votes for each candidate

``` r

    votes_final = votes[voters == voters_total],
    new_vote_prop_sd = sd(new_vote_prop),
  )

  tibble(
    votes_final = seq(min(v$votes_final), max(v$votes_final), length.out = 101),
